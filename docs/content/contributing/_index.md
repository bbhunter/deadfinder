## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/annoying-bug
```

### Code Style

DeadFinder follows Ruby community conventions:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Run RuboCop before committing:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

Fix auto-correctable issues:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### Writing Tests

All new features and bug fixes should include tests:

```ruby
# spec/deadfinder/my_feature_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe DeadFinder::MyFeature do
  describe '#method_name' do
    it 'does something' do
      expect(result).to eq(expected)
    end
  end
end
```

Run tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/deadfinder/my_feature_spec.rb
```
